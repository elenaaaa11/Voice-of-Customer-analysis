positive,2016/10/21,These are very delish - crunchy & flavorful - easy to transport for kids lunches and helps provide the daily requirements for fruit.
positive,2024/10/21,This mix is really good . . . thanks for making our healthy transition easy.  The whole family enjoyed super healthy pancakes this weekend!
positive,2025/9/21,"I tried these before ordering them in bulk and cheaper from Amazon.com.  They are a great nut snack with very low sugar content and high protein content.  While a bit dry, they have good flavor and are good for you.  Much better than most so called energy bars.  And reasonably priced if ordered in bulk through Amazon.com."
positive,2019/10/21,"You can find these here with free shipping and it will save you a trip to the bumper car parking lot of the mall.<br /><br />This is higher quality dog food. I know you may not care, but most brands they sell in the supermarket are really bad for your dog shaving off years of their life.<br /><br />I buy the weight control formula for Becky the Beagle and she has lost enough wieght to actually run! And she did so without starving if that's even possible for a Beagle.<br /><br />Worth every penny if you can get the free shipping. I have a $500.00 deductable on my car and hate going to the mall bumper car parking lots."
positive,2020/10/21,"This tasty cereal has everything going for it. It taste good and has 46 grams of whole grains, which is 96% of your daily minimum of whole grain needs from one bowl. It has a decent amount of fiber and calcium. Good for your morning breakfast or as a snack when you are on the run."
negative,1931/12/20,"there is a taste of sugar substitute, the aftertaste turns me off, I've even tried using a little bit of milk in the mug before hand to hide the taste. It didn't, so i'm just using Swiss miss powder and a little milk to make it a creamier hot chocolate before using using my keurig."
negative,2013/1/20,"I enjoyed these k-cups when I used them. They tasted pretty good. However, I quickly noticed that my Keurig brewer began to have problems after I started using these and other Grove Square k-cups. Even when I would brew other cups, I would get half-brewed cups of coffee, smaller cups, and other issues. I cleaned the brewer, following all the instructions and tips in the manual. The issues came up again as soon as I used these k-cups. What I discovered is that the Grove Square k-cups were gunking up my brewer badly. I had to clean out every part of the brewer completely, including the brewer basket area, the water reservoir, and the internal mechanism. After completing the entire cleaning process two more times my brewer got back to normal. I won't order any Grove Square products again."
negative,2021/9/20,"This hot chocolate tastes like hot sugar water with a pinch of coco in it. Although, even the sugary taste is weak, and tainted by the flavor of the artificial sweetener sucralose. The consistency is watery and bland. This is when I made the 8oz cup as directed by the directions on the box.<br /><br />I do not recommend this product."
negative,2014/7/21,"I really wanted these to taste good, but there is something in there that is very bitter. I had to add too much sugar to make them even slightly palatable. No one would eat them. They LOOKED delicious after baking and they're healthy, but that's only if you manage to choke one down. I have tried their gingerbread, corn muffin mix, and jalapeno cornbread mix and those are all great."
negative,2002/12/20,"I bought these graham sticks based on their excellent reviews and having purchased Earth's Best organic vanilla cookies, had high hopes for a healthy snack to serve my kids.  Needless to say, I should have purchased one box at the grocery store first before committing to 6 boxes through Amazon (which you are unable to return -even unopened boxes- since this is a food item).  The crackers smelled strange even before tasting them.  My 5 year old turned up her nose and refused to eat them anymore after trying a few.  I wish I could describe the taste, but it would be really hard.  It may sound strange for an organic food, but it was almost like a faint chemical smell.  At best, I can say that they weren't anything like a regular graham cracker flavor (even as an organic option they should have a better taste).  My 2 year old did eat some of them without complaint, so I am hoping she will tolerate them through 6 boxes so I feel like I did not waste my money.  Good price, but definitely test one box first to see if you like them."
