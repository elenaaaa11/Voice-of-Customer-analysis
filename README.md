## Task Breakdown

TASK 1 : Sentiment Analysis

TASK 2 : Topic Modeling

To train the topic model from outside of the root directory, run: ```python -m root.src.model.tm.tm_train```. This will train and deposit a topic model into root/models/tm/. Configuration of the training hyperparameters is specified in root/src/model/tm/config.yml.

TASK 3 : Visualisation

To load the visualisation locally, ensure that the packages streamlit and Circlify (in the requirements.txt) are already installed. Run ```streamlit run root/src/visualization/visualize.py``` in the terminal. If successful, the visualisation will be opened in the defualt browser.
